## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS
- BEM pattern
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla JS

### What I learned

While working on that challenge I had a chance to learn how to manipulate the layout with Grid if I need my elements to be placed in different spots. It made writing media queries much easier. I learned as well more about range and checkbox inputs and how to style them. This challenge is very good to practise Javascript: I had to do a lot of research to figure out how to make the input colour change, I learned about object literals and how to use them to store and display data that I need. This challenge gives a great opportunity to practise code refactoring and delegating parts of code to the functions.

### Continued development

I plan on taking up challenges that requires more Javascript writing to practise.
